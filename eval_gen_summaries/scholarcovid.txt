Virus discovery by the VIDISCA method
Identification of unknown pathogens using molecular biology tools is difficult because the target sequence is not known, so genome-specific PCR primers cannot be designed. After the second PCR amplification step, unique and prominent DNA fragments were present in the test sample but not in the control (1 of 16 selective PCR reactions is shown in Fig. Detection of HCoV-NL63 in patient specimens
To show that HCoV-NL63 originated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate of the child, we designed a diagnostic RT-PCR that specifically detects HCoV-NL63. The sequence of the RT-PCR product of the 1b gene was identical to that of the virus identified upon in vitro passage in LLC-MK2 cells (data not shown). The 5′ two-thirds contain the 1a and 1b genes that encode the nonstructural polyproteins, followed by the genes encoding four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The genomes of known coronaviruses contain a variable number of unique characteristic open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nonstructural proteins either between the 1b and S genes, between the S and E genes, between the M and N genes, or downstream of the N gene. ORF3, located between the S and E genes, probably encodes a single accessory nonstructural protein; this gene showed only limited similarity to ORF4A and ORF4B of HCoV-229E and ORF3 of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The cDNA bank that we sequenced contained copies of the subgenomic mRNA for the N protein, thus providing the opportunity to exactly map the leader sequence that is fused to all subgenomic mRNAs. To confirm that HCoV-NL63 is a new member of the group 1 coronaviruses, we conducted phylogenetic analysis using the nucleotide sequence of the 1a, 1b, S, M and N genes (Fig. The N-terminal region of the S protein has been implicated in binding to aminopeptidase N (group I coronaviruses) and sialic acid31,32,33, so the 179–amino acid insert in HCoV-NL63 might be involved in receptor binding and may explain the tropism of this virus in cell culture. 33), so it seems unlikely that the insertion will be directly involved in binding to aminopeptidase N. Fourth, whereas HCoV-229E is fastidious in cell culture with a narrow host range, HCoV-NL63 replicates efficiently in monkey kidney cells. Variability at the 5′ end of the S gene, correlating with alterations in tropism, has also been described for the group 1 coronaviruses porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Even the RT-PCR assay that was designed to amplify all known coronaviruses40 is not able to amplify HCoV-NL63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences. The MseI and HinP1I anchors were prepared by mixing a top-strand oligonucleotide (5′-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3′ for the MseI anchor and 5′-GACGATGAGTCCTGAC-3′ for the HinP1I anchor) with a bottom-strand oligonucleotide (5′-TAGGTACGCAGTC-3′ for the MseI anchor and 5′-CGGTCAGGACTCAT-3′ for the HinP1I anchor) in a 1:40 dilution of ligase buffer. Twenty cycles of PCR were carried out with 10 μl of the ligation mixture, 100 ng of HinP1I standard primer (5′-GACGATGAGTCCTGACCGC-3′) and 100 ng of MseI standard primer (5′-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACCTAA-3′). Five microliters of this PCR product was used as input in the second 'selective' amplification step, along with 100 ng HinP1I N-primer and 100 ng MseI N-primer (the 'N' indicates that the standard primers were extended with one nucleotide; G, A, T or C). The selective rounds of amplification were done using 'touchdown PCR': 10 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (annealing temperature reduced by 1 °C per cycle); 23 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed on 4% Metaphor agarose gels (Cambrex), and the fragments of interest were cloned and sequenced using BigDye terminator reagents. VIDISCA was modified for parvovirus B19 detection as follows: the reverse transcription step was excluded; only HinP1I digestion and adaptor ligation were performed; the first PCR reaction was performed with 35 cycles instead of 20; and the first PCR fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples had been collected for routine viral diagnostic screening of people suffering from upper and/or lower respiratory tract diseases, and the patients consented that their samples be used for testing of respiratory viruses that included coronaviruses. The reverse transcription was performed with MMLV-RT (Invitrogen), using 10 ng of reverse transcription primer (repSZ-RT, 5′-CCACTATAAC-3′; coordinate 16232 in HCoV-NL63). The entire reverse transcription mixture was added to the first PCR mixture containing 100 ng of primer repSZ-1 (5′-GTGATGCATATGCTAATTTG-3′; coordinate 15973) and 100 ng of primer repSZ-3 (5′-CTCTTGCAGGTATAATCCTA-3′; coordinate 16210). The PCR reaction consisted of the following steps: 95 °C for 5 min; then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; then 72 °C for 10 min. A nested PCR was started using 5 μl of the first PCR product with 100 ng of primer repSZ-2 (5′-TTGGTAAACAAAAGATAACT-3′; coordinate 16012) and 100 ng of primer repSZ-4 (5′-TCAATGCTATAAACAGTCAT-3′; coordinate 16181). To verify negative and positive PCR results, an additional diagnostic RT-PCR assay was conducted using the 1a gene primers 5′-AATATGTCTAACAAATAAAACGATT-3′ (reverse transcriptase primer P4H10-3; coordinate 6667), 5′-CTTTTGATAACGGTCACTATG-3′ (SS 5852-5P; coordinate 5777) and 5′-CTCATTACATAAAACATCAAACGG-3′ (P4G1M-5-3P; coordinate 6616) in the first PCR; and 5′-GGTCACTATGTAGTTTATGATG-3′ (P3E2-5P; coordinate 5788) and 5′-GGATTTTTCATAACCACTTAC-3′ (SS 6375-3P; coordinate 6313) in the nested PCR.
