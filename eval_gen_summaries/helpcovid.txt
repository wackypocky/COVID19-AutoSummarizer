As a result, people are looking for ways to help. But being house-bound and social distancing makes helping a challenge, so here are seven ways you can help those in need:

1. And with phone apps and online programs, you can get real face time and share a smile, which activates areas in the brain associated with happiness. However, many places sell products online and offer gift certificates, which can provide an immediate injection of money. Donate to your local food bank

Even with support for local businesses and government funds being poured into society, a lot of people are struggling financially. You can donate money online to food banks, which goes further than non-perishable food donations due to bulk purchases. If you can go out, lend a hand

If you’re not in quarantine or at high risk (over 65 years of age or have a pre-existing medical condition), you can always lend a hand to a neighbour. If you don’t personally know anyone in need, but still want to lend a hand, there are websites such as VancouverSupport.ca that allow you to post offers of help. There is also Nextdoor, an app that lets people view what help their neighbours need. And if you need help yourself, you can also post your needs there as well. These clinics have also put in stringent measures to ensure the safety of donors and have stopped accepting walk-ins, so you will need to book an appointment to donate. People in cities around the world have been participating in signs of gratitude to health-care workers such as collectively clapping and making noise at 7 p.m. each night. There are also many other people still working to keep our communities going, from the grocery store clerk to the letter carrier to those collecting the garbage each week.
