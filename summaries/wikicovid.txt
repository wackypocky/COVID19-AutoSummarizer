The incubation period for COVID‑19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days,[47][48] although 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. [63]

COVID-19 is a new disease, and the ways it spreads between people are under investigation, including: the predominant role of small droplets, the extent to when and how it may be transmitted through air, and how long expelled droplets remain infectious on surfaces. [115][116][117] Likewise, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity—called raising the line—such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, helps to meet increased demand. [130] For the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) face masks "... could be considered especially when visiting busy closed spaces ..." but "... only as a complementary measure ..."[131] Several countries have recommended that healthy individuals wear face masks or cloth face coverings (like scarves or bandanas) at least in certain public settings, including China,[132] Hong Kong,[133] Spain,[134] Italy (Lombardy region),[135] Russia,[136] and the United States. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis". [150][151][152] The WHO and NIH do not oppose the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen for symptoms,[124][153] and the FDA says currently there is no evidence that NSAIDs worsen COVID‑19 symptoms. [124][155][156][157] One study from April 22 found that people with COVID-19 and hypertension had lower all-cause mortality when on these medications. [164] For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID‑19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.

Total infection fatality rate is estimated to be 0.66% (0.39–1.3). [247][248][249][250] These cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection,[250] or false positives due to remaining RNA fragments. [264]

Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. [266]

Society and culture

Name

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",[291][292][293] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". [297]

In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended 2019-nCov[298] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[299] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor.

Medications

At least 29 phase II–IV efficacy trials in COVID‑19 were concluded in March 2020 or scheduled to provide results in April from hospitals in China.
