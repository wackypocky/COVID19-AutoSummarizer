Healthcare systems are overwhelmed and many people are struggling as social distancing and the economic impact takes a toll. Charities across Canada and are launching urgent appeals for help. You can support our hospitals and frontline healthcare workers, and care for the sick. Help is also needed to deal with an unprecedented need for food banks, provide support to seniors, children in need, those experiencing homelessness, and many others in our communities.
