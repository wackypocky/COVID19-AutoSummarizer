These past few weeks have been difficult for all of us, and we hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe. Some of you have asked about how you can help vulnerable children and families in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are a few answers to your questions.
How have communities been affected by the COVID-19 crisis?
Children are most vulnerable in this time of crisis. Communities in Canada and internationally have reached out to say that children and families are struggling to access food at this time and are looking for our support to help. As we learn more from our partners, we will update you. Sign up for email updates to stay informed.
We heard from one of our partners, Birch Narrows Dene Nation in northern Saskatchewan, and how the pandemic has been challenging. “Our most urgent need is having enough fresh and nutritious food for the community,” they told us. Read how this community is tackling food insecurity – and how you can help.
What is CFTC’s response to the crisis?
The health and safety of our program participants, global partners and staff and volunteers are of the utmost priority. We are following local and international health authority guidelines in all of the countries where we work, and are in regular contact with our partner communities in Canada and internationally to understand their shifting needs. We are taking the lead from our communities and are prioritizing support where need is greatest. This will be done on a case by case basis.
How can I help?
Your ongoing support is needed more than ever. In the communities we are working with, children and families are already facing challenges that many of us could never imagine and those challenges have become even harder with the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Please give now at this secure donation link to help support vulnerable children and families during this crisis and beyond.
Where will my donation go?
