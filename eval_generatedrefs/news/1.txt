A television station employee was shot dead on Friday in the northwestern city of Peshawar as violent crowds filled the streets of several cities on a day of government-sanctioned protests against an anti-Islam film made in the United States.

The unrest came as governments and Western institutions in many parts of the Muslim world braced for protests after Friday Prayer an occasion often associated with demonstrations as worshipers leave mosques.

In Pakistan, the scene of the most turbulent unrest, ARY News said that a driver, Muhammad Amir, was shot three times by the police as he drove through an area where stick-wielding protesters were burning a movie theater owned by a prominent politician.

Businesses closed and streets emptied across the country as the government declared a national holiday, the "Day of Love for the Prophet Muhammad," to encourage peaceful protests against the controversial film that has ignited protest across the Muslim world for more than a week.

In Peshawar, where the television employee was killed, protesters attacked and burned two movie theaters, breaking through the windows with sticks and setting fire to posters that featured images of female movie stars.
