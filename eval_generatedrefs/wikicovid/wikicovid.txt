COVID-19 is a new disease, and the ways it spreads between people are under investigation, including: the predominant role of small droplets, the extent to when and how it may be transmitted through air, and how long expelled droplets remain infectious on surfaces. Likewise, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity—called raising the line—such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, helps to meet increased demand. For the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control face masks "... could be considered especially when visiting busy closed spaces ..." but "... only as a complementary measure ..." Several countries have recommended that healthy individuals wear face masks or cloth face coverings at least in certain public settings, including China, Hong Kong, Spain, Italy , Russia, and the United States.

Goal is a negative balance of 0.5–1.0L per day


10.4–27.3
Note: The lower bound includes all cases. These cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection, or false positives due to remaining RNA fragments.
