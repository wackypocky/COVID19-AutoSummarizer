They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.[169] When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.[170]

Mechanical ventilation

Most cases of COVID‑19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.[171][172] The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID‑19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in the hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.[173] Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.[174] Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.[171]

Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years,[171] and especially those older than 80 years).[175] Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID‑19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.[176] This limited capacity is a significant driver behind calls to flatten the curve.[176] One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.[37] In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID‑19 are eventually admitted to ICU.[4]

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

Main article: Acute respiratory distress syndrome

Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID‑19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.[177] Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP[178] are needed to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.[179] High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.[citation needed]

High-flow nasal oxygen

For SpO2 <93%. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.[228] This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[229]
