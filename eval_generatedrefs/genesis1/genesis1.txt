In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.
Then God said, «Let there be light»; and there was light.
And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
And God saw that it was good.
Then God said, «Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.» And it was so.
The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.
And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
And God saw that it was good.
God blessed them, saying, «Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth».
And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
And God said, «Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.» And it was so.
God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind.
