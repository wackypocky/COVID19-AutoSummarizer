However, the droplets are relatively heavy and usually fall to the ground or surfaces, as opposed to being infectious over large distances.[6][19] After the droplets fall to floors or surfaces, they still can infect other people, if they touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.[6] On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection.[19] However, experimentally, the virus can survive on various surfaces for some time, (for example copper or cardboard for a few hours, and plastic or steel for a few days).[19][64] Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.[6] Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID-19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as inside the human body.[65] Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.[66][6][17][19] Some medical procedures may result in the virus being transmitted easier than normal for such small droplets, known as airborne transmission.[6][19] The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread is known to occur up to two days before symptoms appear (presymptomatic transmission) and in later stages of the disease.[17][19][67][68] Some people have been infected and recovered without showing symptoms, but uncertainties remain in terms of asymptomatic transmission.[19] Although COVID-19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.[69][70] Virology Main article: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Illustration of SARSr-CoV virion Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[71] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[72] Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[23] SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[73] It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.

The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.[228] This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[229] Case fatality rates (%) by age and country or US state Age 0–9 10–19 20–29 30–39 40–49 50–59 60–69 70–79 80-89 90+ Canada as of 5 May[230] 0.0 0.1 0.6 6.4 21.5 China as of 11 February[206] 0.0 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 1.3 3.6 8.0 14.8 Denmark as of 5 May[231] 0.2 4.4 16.7 26.4 44.3 Germany as of 5 May[232] 0.3 6.9 23.7 Israel as of 3 May[233] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.9 0.9 3.1 9.7 22.9 30.8 31.3 Italy as of 28 April[209] 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.3 0.9 2.6 9.8 24.2 29.0 24.7 KY state as of 5 May[234] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.6 2.3 6.8 13.3 27.9 MA state as of 5 May[235] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.4 1.3 4.5 14.2 24.7 Netherlands as of 25 April[236] 0.0 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.5 1.5 7.6 23.2 30.0 29.3 Norway as of 5 May[237] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 1.7 8.5 21.3 50.4 Portugal as of 5 May[238] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.8 3.1 9.5 17.8 South Korea as of 30 April[207] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.2 0.8 2.6 10.4 24.3 Spain as of 5 May[208] 0.3 0.4 0.2 0.3 0.6 1.5 4.8 13.9 20.9 21.9 Sweden as of 5 May[239] 0.9 0.0 0.4 0.4 0.9 2.3 7.4 22.8 32.0 36.1 Switzerland as of 5 May[240] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.5 2.9 10.9 25.9 WA state as of 3 May[241] 0.0 0.2 1.3 9.1 29.8 Case fatality rates (%) by age in the United States Age 0–19 20–44 45–54 55–64 65–74 75–84 85+ United States as of 16 March[242] 0.0 0.1–0.2 0.5–0.8 1.4–2.6 2.7–4.9 4.3–10.5 10.4–27.3 Note: The lower bound includes all cases.
