A television station employee was shot dead on Friday in the northwestern city of Peshawar as violent crowds filled the streets of several cities on a day of government-sanctioned protests against an anti-Islam film made in the United States.
The unrest came as governments and Western institutions in many parts of the Muslim world braced for protests after Friday Prayer an occasion often associated with demonstrations as worshipers leave mosques. In Tunisia, the authorities invoked emergency powers to outlaw all demonstrations, fearing an outpouring of anti-Western protest inspired both by the American-made film and by cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a French satirical weekly. The protesters threatened to seize the American Embassy on Saturday, but a police order banned any further demonstrations. France had already announced the closure on Friday of embassies and other institutions in 20 countries while, in Paris, some Muslim leaders urged their followers to heed a government ban on weekend demonstrations protesting against denigration of the prophet.

Businesses closed and streets emptied across the country as the government declared a national holiday, the "Day of Love for the Prophet Muhammad," to encourage peaceful protests against the controversial film that has ignited protest across the Muslim world for more than a week.
